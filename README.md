# Official Manga Release RSS Generator

There aren't any good sources for official RSS feeds for official manga releases from traditional manga publishers, so I created this to make an RSS feed for me. It runs once a day to look for new manga releases on today's date, and if there are, it adds them to an RSS feed.

## Supported Publishers

* Kodansha
* Square Enix
* Viz
* Yen Press

I'd like to support Seven Seas Entertainment as well, but they block scrapers and I'm not going to try and work around their protections.
